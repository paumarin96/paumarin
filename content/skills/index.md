## Programming

**Languages I know:** C++, C#, Kotlin, GLSL and OpenGL 4


### Engines

#### Unity

I have multiple years of experience working with Unity on small-scale projects, and I'm highly proficient with C# programming inside of Unity.

#### Unreal Engine

I have started to learn Unreal Engine, and have been using it for my new projects. While I don't program Unreal with C++ yet, I'm eager to learn in the next few months when I have time.

### Graphics Programming

I've developed a simple graphics engine with OpenGL and C++. It was part of a University assignment, and while the code is certainly not the cleanest (it was not the main focus), I really understood the basics of graphics programming, and I'm eager to learn more as it's one of my areas of interest.

I also know **GLSL Shader** programming, and have worked with Shader Graph in **Unity** and the **UE Shader Editor**.

## Art and Design

While definitely not my main area of focus, I like having an understanding
of how art is done in videogames, and I'd also consider myself to be a competent game designer. If you play my games, you can certainly see a bit of my game design in there.   

I have a basic knowledge of **Blender**, **Substance Painter** and **Substance Designer**

I can make 3D Models, texture them with modern PBR techniques, and basic rigging / animation of 3D characters.

## Other skills

I have a good level of the **Adobe Photoshop, Premiere, Illustrator, XD.**

I'm also a hobbist music producer, using **Ableton Live**
