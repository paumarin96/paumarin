## Hi, I'm Pau
I'm a game programmer based on Barcelona, Spain.
My current area of focus is gameplay programming, but I also have a huge interest on rendering, shaders and technical art in general.

I'm a hard-working individual who enjoys attention to detail and creating the best user experience possible.
I enjoy learning a lot of things, and I have a huge passion for technology and learning the latest.
I also enjoy working with teams, as for learning from other people and teaching as well.

In my free time, I enjoy music production, travelling, and tinkering around with shaders, materials and prototypes, as well as gaming, of course!
