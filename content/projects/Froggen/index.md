summary: "Physics-based platformer where you play as a frog with a long tongue"

## You are a frog with a very long tongue!

[Froggen](https://bitplayy.itch.io/froggen) is a physics-based platformer where the main mechanic is having a long tongue.
You can use your tongue to grab enemies, grapple around and climb platforms!

It was my second year project for ENTI-UB University, and it was made in about 6 months
with a team of 3 people (including me).

I was the lead developer and artist, and made all the physics and rendering of the
tongue, which was a big endeavour and took a lot of iterations to get right.

## Creating a physics-based tongue

For this game, we wanted to have a physics-based tongue instead of a plain line.
In the end, scope was too big and we couldn't finish enough mechanics to use the tongue,
but the main grappling and enemy combat is pretty good, although the level design
could really use some work.

I may write a blog post of how I approached it in the future.
