Sweet Dreams is a simple 2D scroll based platformer.
It was made in the span of 5 months during the Projects class.

I was the lead developer and graphic designer of the project.

It won the ENTI Best Game of 1st course Prize, which is an anual event
that celebrates the games that have been made at ENTI-UB University.
