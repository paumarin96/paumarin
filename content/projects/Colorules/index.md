## A game made in 5 days

Colorules is a small game made in the Game Gen Game jam, by a team of 5 people.

The theme of the jam was to make a game with 3 rules. In our case, we made a game were color combinations make the 3 rules, and you control a ball with your mouse:

- If you touch the same color as your, you loose.
- Touching a different color swaps the colors.
- You can destroy objects by touching them with their complementary color

## My contributions to this project

I was the programmer for the main color mechanics, while movement and the general flow of the game was made by my collegues.

It was also my first jam, and I really liked the result and enjoyed the development.
