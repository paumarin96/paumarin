## Technical skills

### Programming languages

- C++
- C#
- Unreal Blueprints
- Kotlin
- GLSL & HLSL


### Engines

- Unreal Engine
- Unity
- OpenGL4

#### Unity

I have multiple years of experience working with Unity on small-scale projects, and I'm highly proficient with C# programming inside of Unity.

#### Unreal Engine

While I don't have as much experience on Unreal compared to Unity, I feel like I have learned the engine quite fast and I'd say i'm on the same level as Unity.

I don't program Unreal with C++ yet but I'm eager to learn in the next few months when I have time.

### Shaders and technical art

Technical art is one of my main areas of interest, and I would like to focus on it for my career. 

I've developed a simple graphics engine with OpenGL and C++. It was part of a University assignment, and while the code is certainly not the cleanest (it was not the main focus), I really understood the basics of graphics programming, and I'm eager to learn more as it's one of my areas of interest.

I also know **GLSL Shader** programming, and have worked with Shader Graph in **Unity** and the **UE Shader Editor**.

### Other technical skills
- Gameplay programming
- Git & Gitflow
- Strong math knowledge


## Habilities

### AGILE Methodologies
I have experience with JIRA

### 3D art and animation
While definitely not my main area of focus, I like having an understanding
of how art is done in videogames, and I'd also consider myself to be a competent game designer. If you play my games, you can certainly see a bit of my game design in there.   

I have a basic knowledge of **Blender**, **Substance Painter** and **Substance Designer**

I can make 3D Models, texture them with modern PBR techniques, and basic rigging / animation of 3D characters.

### Game and Level Design knowledge
I have some game and level design knowledge, like KPIs, game balance, rewards, etc...

### Soft skills and hobbies
Good communicator, responsable and fast learner. I also work good with teams.

I have a good level of the **Adobe Photoshop, Premiere, Illustrator, XD.**

I'm also a hobbist music producer, using **Ableton Live**
